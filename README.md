Ansible role used by RDO to deploy the RDO dasboard

Code of the dashboard is on https://github.com/rdo-infra/rdo-dashboards

# Usage

The role can be used like this:

```
$ cat deploy_dashboards.yml
- hosts: web
  roles:
  - role: rdo_dasboards
    website_domain: dashboard.example.org
```

Since the role use the role httpd from http://github.com/OSAS/ansible-role-httpd,
several options can be used to enable https with letsencrypt and others. See the 
documentation of the httpd role for more information

This role needs the new API currently only available in the
'duck_work_during_misc_vacation' branch.

# Code and data refresh

The data is updated every 15 minutes, using a cron job running as a non privileged
user. The code itself is updated every 20 minutes using a cron job, and the whole 
application run under a user that has no specific privilege.

# Authentication between script and frontend

To ensure that no one can push bogus information, a variable `token_auth` must be declared.
However, this is not critical to protect, and a random variable could simply be used
for every deployment and things would be fine.
